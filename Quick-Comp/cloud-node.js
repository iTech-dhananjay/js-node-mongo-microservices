/*
    - NGINX is a powerful web server and uses a non-threaded, event-driven architecture.
    - It can also do other important things, such as load balancing, and HTTP caching, or be used as a reverse proxy.
    - A reverse proxy utilizes multiple servers but serves a single client. NGINX determines the appropriate server for sending requests and fetching responses, thereby facilitating load balancing.
         - Can Handle 10,000 Concurrent Requests
         - Cache HTTP Requests
         - Act as Reverse Proxy
         - Act as Load Balancer
         - Act as an API Gateway
         - Serve and Cache Static files like images, videos, etc.
         - Handle SSL Certificates
